How to use?

Each code line must contain 16bits or equivalent information keep that in mind
You can leave a line empty for formating reasons but notice that it will completly be ignored.
This is very important when you address lines, remind yourself of the empty lines

The Assembler runs over the code starting at the first line and working its way through it.
Every line is than treated as a command, regardless of your intention to use it. So if you put
0000000000000011 in a line and the assembler runs the command it recognizes it as QUIT and stops working

Each command has parameters (even though it might ignore them) and is split into different parts in order to
get those parameters.

There are 2 different type of commands 4bit commands and 8bit commands. All 4bit commands start with a 1 thus all
8bit commands start with a 0. These different commands are used to modify the memory and the registers. Notice
that your whole code is loaded into the memory at the beginning. Currently the max size of the memory is 64, but
it can be easily adjusted(if you are me). However the current size of a memory address is 8bit.

Registers are 16bit storages directly in the controller, which are used in most operations. While memory has
only different addresses the registers have names in addition to their number. These names and numbers are:

NAME        | NUMBER
zero        | 0000
one         | 0001
accu        | 0010
register1   | 0011
register2   | 0100
register3   | 0101
register4   | 0110
register5   | 0111
position    | 1111

Not all registers are changeble. one and zero e.g. cant be changed(in this model. you could do so by changing
the code). And even though the position register can be changed(it must be in order to determine the next command)
it is highly recommended only to do this without special commands like jumwhen you really know what you are 
doing. Stuff tends to get messy if you mess with the position register.

So far we know:
Commands are 4/8 bit long
registers addresses are 4bit long
memory addresses are 8bit long

But we dont know the commands yet so lets change that. Commands can be written in 2 ways
1. as a string of numbers e.g. 00000000 for quitting the programm
2. as a string that translates to numbers e.g. QUIT
the parser knows some translations for all commands and some other usefull stuff so feel free
to use it.
here is a list of all translations:

CODE      | TRANSLATION| DESCRIPTION
LOADL     | 1001       | load from following to accu //for longer addresses if needed
SAVEL     | 1010       | save to following to accu //for longer addresses if needed
LOADR     | 1011       | load to reg1 from address
SAVER     | 1100       | save from reg2 to address
EQUALN    | 1101       | equal values of reg1 and reg2 lead to a jump to pos+n
QUIT      | 00000000   | quit the programm run 
LOAD      | 00000001   | load from address to accu 
SAVE      | 00000010   | to address to accu 
ADD       | 00000011   | add reg1 to reg2 and put value into accu
SUB       | 00000100   | subtract reg2 from reg1 and put value into accu
JUMP      | 00000101   | jump to given address
EQUAL     | 00000110   | equal values of reg1 and reg2 lead to a jump to position+2
GREATER   | 00000111   | greater values of reg1 than reg2 lead to a jump to position+2
SMALLER   | 00001000   | smaller values of reg1 than reg2 lead to a jump to position+2
UNEQUAL   | 00001001   | unequal values of reg1 and reg2 lead to a jump to position+2
COPY      | 00001010   | copy value of reg1 into reg2
MULTIPLY  | 00001011   | multiply reg1 and reg2 and put value into accu
SHIFTLEFT | 00001100   | shiftleft reg1 by n
SHIFTRIGHT| 00001101   | shiftright reg2 by n

the arguments are alway listed in order in the description. so when it says: 
"equal values of reg1 and reg2 lead to a jump to pos+n"
the line would be arranged like this:
EQUALN reg1 reg2 n
if you want reg1 to be the one register and reg2 to be register one and the jumplength to be 6 you would write
1101 0001 0011 0101
or
EQUALN 0001 0011 0101

I havent told you yet but: YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY SPACES AS YOU LIKE THEY ARE SIMPLY IGNORED!!! ok calm down...
So you can format the code the way you like it. You can also add comments with a # But notice that everything
behing it will be ignored so that a line only containing a comment counts as a free line.

Also worth noticing: Lines that start with an * contain compiler directives. Use with care. They dont check for
anything. The only thing you can do with them at the moment is setting more translations for the compiler
e.g. by using the line "*var one 0001" the compiler will later translate each occurence of "one" to 0001.
But beware the vars are translated in order so if you add "*var ones 1111" later the codeline ones will translate
to 0001s. So always use either unique names or put the variables with names that contain other variable names first.
For the example switching those lines will do. Also notice that you can overwrite compiler variables like QUIT
so "*var QUIT = 0000 0000 0000 0000 # 16 times" QUIT will compile to 16 zeros. As spaces and comments are cleared at the end.
(in most cases) you can use them in your definitions. 

And here you go. Oh wait as an inspiration I have the following code for you that my girlfriend wrote. It adds
3 and 4 and writes the result into memory field 7:

*var reg1 = 0011
*var reg2 = 0100
LOADR reg1 0000 0101 # load line 5 into reg1 
LOADR reg2 0000 0110 # load line 6 into reg2 
ADD reg1 reg2 # add reg1 and reg2 and write to accu 
SAVE 0000 0111 # save accu to memory address 7 
QUIT EMPTY # quit programm 
0000 0000 0000 0011 # m = 3
0000 0000 0000 0100 # n = 4
